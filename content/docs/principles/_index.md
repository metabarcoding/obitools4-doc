# General operating principles for {{% obitools %}}

{{% obitools %}} are a set of UNIX commands that are used from a command line interface, also named a terminal, to perform various tasks on DNA sequences files. A UNIX command can be considered as a black box that takes a set of inputs and produces a set of outputs.

Most {{% obitools %}} take a single input file and produce a single output file. Among the inputs, one has a special status, the standard input (*stdin*). Symmetrically, there is the standard output (*stdout*). By default, as any other UNIX command, the {{% obitools %}} read their data from *stdin* and write their results to *stdout*.

If nothing is specified, the UNIX system connects standard input to the terminal keyboard and standard output to the terminal screen. So if you run the {{< obi obiconvert >}} command in your terminal without any arguments, it will appear to stop and do nothing, when in fact it is waiting for you to type something on the keyboard. To stop it, just press *Ctrl+D* or *Ctrl+C*. *Ctrl+D* terminates the input and stops the program. *Ctrl+C* kills the program.

## Specifying the input data

{{% obitools %}} are dedicated to process DNA sequences files. Thus, most of them accept as inputs DNA sequences files. They can be formatted in the most common sequence file formats, {{% fasta %}}, {{% fastq %}}, {{% embl %}} and {{% genbank %}} flat files. Data can also be provided as CSV files. The {{% obitools %}} usually recognize the file format of the input data, but options are provided to force a specific format (*i.e.* `--fasta`, `--fastq`, `--genbank`, `--embl`).

The most common way to specify the file containing the DNA sequences to be processed is to specify its name as an argument. Here is an example using {{< obi obicount >}} to count the number of DNA sequences in a file named `my_file.fasta`.

```bash
obicount my_file.fasta
```

But it is also possible to pass the data using the Unix redirection mechanism (*i.e.* `>` and `<`, [more details](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redirection_(computing))).

```bash
obicount < my_file.fasta
```

The {{% obitools %}} can also be used to process a set of files. In this case, the {{% obitools %}} will process the files in the order in which they appear on the command line.

```bash
obicount my_file1.fasta my_file2.fasta my_file3.fasta
```

The wildcard character (*i.e.* `*`) can be used to specify a set of files to be processed.

```bash
obicount my_file*.fasta
```

If the files are in a subdirectory, the directory name can be specified, without the need to specify any file name. In that case, the {{% obitools %}} will process all the sequence files present in the subdirectory. The search for the sequence files is done recursively in the specified directory and all its subdirectories.

```bash
obicount my_sub_directory
```

The files considered as DNA sequence files are those with the file extension `.fasta`, `.fastq`, `.genbank` or `.embl`, `.seq` or `.dat`. Files with the second extension `.gz` (*e.g.* `.fasta.gz`) are also considered to be DNA sequence files and are processed without having to uncompressed them.

Imagine a folder called `Genbank` which contains a complete copy of the Genbank database organized into subdirectories, one per division. Each division subdirectory contains a set of {{% fasta %}} compressed (`.gz`) files.

```

‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ üìÇ bct

‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ üìÑ...
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ üìÇ...
‚îÇ
```

It is possible to count entries in the `gbbact1.fasta.gz` file with the command

```bash
obicount Genbank/bct/gbbact1.fasta.gz
```

to count the entries in the **bac** (bacterial) division with the command

```bash
obicount Genbank/bct
```

or to count the entries in the complete Genbank copy with the command

```bash
obicount Genbank
```

## Specifying what to do with the output

By default, {{% obitools %}} write their output to standard output (*stdout*), which means that the results of a command are printed to the terminal screen. 

Most {{% obitools %}} produce sequence files as output. The output sequence file is in {{% fasta %}} or {{% fastq %}} format, depending on whether it contains quality scores ({{% fastq %}}) or not ({{% fasta %}}). The output format for sequence files can be forced using the `--fasta-output` or `--fastq-output` options. If the `--fastq-output` option is used for a data set without quality information, a default quality score of 40 will be used for each nucleotide. A third option is the `--json-output` option, which outputs the data in a {{% json %}} format.

Except for {{< obi obisummary >}}, the {{% obitools %}} which produce other
types of data output them in CSV format. The {{< obi obisummary >}} command
returns its results in [JSON](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON) or
[YAML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML) format.

The {{< obi obicomplement >}} command computes the reverse-complement of the DNA sequences provided as input. 

{{< code "two_sequences.fasta" fasta true >}} 

If the `two_sequences.fasta` file is processed with the {{< obi obicomplement >}} command, without indicating the output file name, the result is written to terminal screen.

```bash
obicomplement two_sequences.fasta
```
{{< code "two_sequences_comp.fasta" fasta false >}} 

To save the results in a file, two possible options are available. The first one is to redirect the output to a file, as in the following example.

```bash
obicomplement two_sequences.fasta > two_sequences_comp.fasta
```

The second option is to use the `--out` option.

```bash
obicomplement two_sequences.fasta --out two_sequences_comp.fasta
```

Both methods will produce the same result, a file named <a href="two_sequences_comp.fasta" download="two_sequences_comp.fasta">`two_sequences_comp.fasta`</a> containing the reverse-complement of the DNA sequences contained in <a href="two_sequences.fasta" download="two_sequences.fasta">`two_sequences.fasta`</a>.

## Combining {{% obitools %}} commands using pipes

As the {{% obitools %}} are UNIX commands, and their default behaviour is to read their input from *stdin* and write their output to *stdout*, it is possible to combine them using the Unix pipe mechanism (*i.e.* `|`). For example, you can reverse-complement the file `two_sequences.fasta` with the command {{% obi obicomplement %}}, and then count the number of DNA sequences in the resulting file with the command {{% obi obicount %}}, without saving the intermediate results, by linking the *stdout* of {{% obi obicomplement %}} to the *stdin* of {{% obi obicount %}}.
<!-- I suggest to use obigrep instead of obicomplement as the first command. obigrep can be to select sequences longer (or shorter) than xxx bp. As a consequence, the file two_sequence.fasta should be changed -->


```bash
obicomplement two_sequences.fasta | obicount 
```
```csv
entities,n
variants,2
reads,3
symbols,200
```

The result of the {{% obi obicount %}} command is a CSV file. Therefore, it can itself be piped to another command, like [`csvtomd`](https://github.com/mplewis/csvtomd) to reformat the result in a Markdown table.

```bash
obicomplement two_sequences.fasta | obicount | csvtomd
```
```md
entities  |  n
----------|-----
variants  |  2
reads     |  3
symbols   |  200
```

Or being plotted with the [`uplot`](https://github.com/red-data-tools/YouPlot) command.

```bash
obicomplement two_sequences.fasta | obicount | uplot barplot -H -d,
```
```
                               n

            ‚îî                                        ‚îò 
```

## The tagging system of {{% obitools %}}

The {{% obitools %}} provide several tools to perform computations on the sequences. The result of such a computation may be the selection of a subset of the input sequences, a modification of the sequences themselves, or it may only lead to the estimation of some properties of the sequences. In the latter case, the {{% obitools %}} stores the estimated properties of the associated sequence in a {{% fasta %}} or {{% fastq %}} file. To achieve this, the {{% obitools %}} add structured information in the form of a JSON map to the header of each sequence. The JSON map allows the results of calculations to be stored in key-value pairs. Each {{% obitools %}} command adds one or more key-value pairs to the JSON map as needed to annotate a sequence. Below is an example of a {{% fasta %}} formatted sequence with a JSON map added to its header containing three key-value pairs: `count` associated with the value `2`, `is_annotated` associated with the value `true` and `xxxx` associated with the value `yyyy`.


```
>sequence1 {"count": 2, "is_annotated": true, "xxxx": "yyy"}
cgacgtagctgtgatgcagtgcagttatattttacgtgctatgtttcagtttttttt
fdcgacgcagcggag
```

Keys can be any string. Their names are case-sensitive. The keys `count`, `Count` and `COUNT` are all considered to different keys. The values can be any string, integer, float, or boolean values. Values can also be of composite types but with some limitations compared to the [JSON](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON) format.
