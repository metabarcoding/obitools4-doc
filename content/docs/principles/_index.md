# General operating principles for {{% obitools %}}

{{% obitools %}} are not a metabarcoding data analysis pipeline, but a set of tools for developing customized analysis, while avoiding the black-box effect of a ready-to-use pipeline. A particular effort in the development of {{% obitools4 %}} has been to use data formats that can be easily interfaced with other software.

{{% obitools %}} correspond to a set of UNIX commands that are used from a command line interface, also named a terminal, to perform various tasks on DNA sequence files. A UNIX command can be considered as a process that takes a set of inputs and produces a set of outputs.

{{< /mermaid >}}

Most {{% obitools %}} take a single input file and produce a single output file. Among the inputs, one has a special status, the standard input (*stdin*). Symmetrically, there is the standard output (*stdout*). By default, as any other UNIX command, the {{% obitools %}} read their data from *stdin* and write their results to *stdout*.

  C[Unix command]
  D@{ shape: doc, label: "stdout" }

  classDef obitools fill:#99d57c
{{< /mermaid >}}

If nothing is specified, the UNIX system connects standard input to the terminal keyboard and standard output to the terminal screen. So if you run, as example, the {{< obi obiconvert >}} command in your terminal without any arguments, it will appear to stop and do nothing, when in fact it is waiting for you to type something on the keyboard. To stop it, just press *Ctrl+D* or *Ctrl+C*. *Ctrl+D* terminates the input and stops the program. *Ctrl+C* kills the program.

## Specifying the input data

{{% obitools %}} are dedicated to process DNA sequence files. Thus, most of them accept as inputs DNA sequence files. They can be formatted in the most common sequence file formats, {{% fasta %}}, {{% fastq %}}, {{% embl %}} and {{% genbank %}} flat files. Data can also be provided as CSV files. The {{% obitools %}} usually recognize the file format of the input data, but options are provided to force a specific format (*i.e.* `--fasta`, `--fastq`, `--genbank`, `--embl`).

The most common way to specify the file containing the DNA sequences to be processed is to specify its name as an argument. Here is an example using {{< obi obicount >}} to count the number of DNA sequences in a file named `my_file.fasta`.

```bash
obicount my_file.fasta
```

But it is also possible to pass the data using the Unix redirection mechanism (*i.e.* `>` and `<`, [more details](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redirection_(computing))).

```bash
obicount < my_file.fasta
```

The {{% obitools %}} can also be used to process a set of files. In this case, the {{% obitools %}} will process the files in the order in which they appear on the command line.

```bash
obicount my_file1.fasta my_file2.fasta my_file3.fasta
```

The wildcard character (*i.e.* `*`) can be used to specify a set of files to be processed.

```bash
obicount my_file*.fasta
```

If the files are in a subdirectory, the directory name can be specified, without the need to specify any file name. In that case, the {{% obitools %}} will process all the sequence files present in the subdirectory. The search for the sequence files is done recursively in the specified directory and all its subdirectories.

```bash
obicount my_sub_directory
```

The files considered as DNA sequence files are those with the file extension `.fasta`, `.fastq`, `.genbank` or `.embl`, `.seq` or `.dat`. Files with the second extension `.gz` (*e.g.* `.fasta.gz`) are also considered to be DNA sequence files and are processed without having to uncompressed them.

Imagine a folder called `Genbank` which contains a complete copy of the Genbank database organized into subdirectories, one per division. Each division subdirectory contains a set of {{% fasta %}} compressed (`.gz`) files.

```

‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ üìÑ...
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ üìÇ...
‚îÇ
```

It is possible to count entries in the `gbbct1.fasta.gz` file with the command

```bash
obicount Genbank/bct/gbbct1.fasta.gz
```

to count the entries in the **bct** (bacterial) division with the command

```bash
obicount Genbank/bct
```

or to count the entries in the complete Genbank copy with the command

```bash
obicount Genbank
```

## Specifying what to do with the output

By default, {{% obitools %}} write their output to standard output (*stdout*), which means that the results of a command are printed to the terminal screen. 

Most {{% obitools %}} produce sequence files as output. The output sequence file is in {{% fasta %}} or {{% fastq %}} format, depending on whether it contains quality scores ({{% fastq %}}) or not ({{% fasta %}}). The output format for sequence files can be forced using the `--fasta-output` or `--fastq-output` options. If the `--fastq-output` option is used for a data set without quality information, a default quality score of 40 will be used for each nucleotide. A third option is the `--json-output` option, which outputs the data in a {{% json %}} format.

Except for {{< obi obisummary >}}, the {{% obitools %}} which produce other
types of data output them in CSV format. The {{< obi obisummary >}} command
returns its results in [JSON](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON) or
[YAML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML) format.

The {{< obi obicomplement >}} command computes the reverse-complement of the DNA sequences provided as input. 

{{< code "two_sequences.fasta" fasta true >}} 

If the `two_sequences.fasta` file is processed with the {{< obi obicomplement >}} command, without indicating the output file name, the result is written to terminal screen.

```bash
obicomplement two_sequences.fasta
```
{{< code "two_sequences_comp.fasta" fasta false >}} 

To save the results in a file, two possible options are available. The first one is to redirect the output to a file, as in the following example.

```bash
obicomplement two_sequences.fasta > two_sequences_comp.fasta
```

The second option is to use the `--out` option.

```bash
obicomplement two_sequences.fasta --out two_sequences_comp.fasta
```

Both methods will produce the same result, a file named <a href="two_sequences_comp.fasta" download="two_sequences_comp.fasta">`two_sequences_comp.fasta`</a> containing the reverse-complement of the DNA sequences contained in <a href="two_sequences.fasta" download="two_sequences.fasta">`two_sequences.fasta`</a>.

## Combining {{% obitools %}} commands using pipes

As the {{% obitools %}} are UNIX commands, and their default behaviour is to read their input from *stdin* and write their output to *stdout*, it is possible to combine them using the Unix pipe mechanism (*i.e.* `|`). For example, you can reverse-complement the file `two_sequences.fasta` with the command {{% obi obicomplement %}}, and then count the number of DNA sequences in the resulting file with the command {{% obi obicount %}}, without saving the intermediate results, by linking the *stdout* of {{% obi obicomplement %}} to the *stdin* of {{% obi obicount %}}.
<!-- I suggest to use obigrep instead of obicomplement as the first command. obigrep can be to select sequences longer (or shorter) than xxx bp. As a consequence, the file two_sequence.fasta should be changed -->


```bash
obicomplement two_sequences.fasta | obicount 
```
```
entities,n
variants,2
reads,3
symbols,200
```

The result of the {{% obi obicount %}} command is a CSV file. Therefore, it can itself be piped to another command, like [`csvtomd`](https://github.com/mplewis/csvtomd) to reformat the result in a Markdown table.

```bash
obicomplement two_sequences.fasta | obicount | csvtomd
```
```
entities  |  n
----------|-----
variants  |  2
reads     |  3
symbols   |  200
```

Or being plotted with the [`uplot`](https://github.com/red-data-tools/YouPlot) command.

```bash
obicomplement two_sequences.fasta | obicount | uplot barplot -H -d,
```
```
                               n

```

## The tagging system of {{% obitools %}}

The {{% obitools %}} provide several tools to perform computations on the sequences. The result of such a computation may be the selection of a subset of the input sequences, a modification of the sequences themselves, or it may only lead to the estimation of some properties of the sequences. In the latter case, the {{% obitools %}} stores the estimated properties of the associated sequence in a {{% fasta %}} or {{% fastq %}} file. To achieve this, the {{% obitools %}} add structured information in the form of a JSON map to the header of each sequence. The JSON map allows the results of calculations to be stored in key-value pairs. Each {{% obitools %}} command adds one or more key-value pairs to the JSON map as needed to annotate a sequence. Below is an example of a {{% fasta %}} formatted sequence with a JSON map added to its header containing three key-value pairs: `count` associated with the value `2`, `is_annotated` associated with the value `true` and `xxxx` associated with the value `yyyy`.

```
>sequence1 {"count": 2, "is_annotated": true, "xxxx": "yyy"}
cgacgtagctgtgatgcagtgcagttatattttacgtgctatgtttcagtttttttt
fdcgacgcagcggag
```

### The key names

Keys can be any string. Their names are case-sensitive. The keys `count`,
`Count` and `COUNT` are all considered to different keys. Some key names are
reserved by the {{% obitools %}} and have special meanings (*e.g.* `count`
contains if present an integer value indication how many times that sequence has
been observed, `taxid` that contains string value corresponding to a taxonomic
identifier from a taxonomy). 

### The tag values

The values can be any string, integer, float, or boolean values. Values can also
be of composite types but with some limitations compared to the
[JSON](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON) format. In {{% obitools4 %}} annotations
you are not allowed to nest composite type. A list cannot contain a list or a map.

A list is an ordered set of values, here as example a set of integer values:

```json
[1,3,2,12]
```

A map is a set of values indexed by a key which is a string. Here as example a
map of integer values:

```json
{"toto":4,"titi":10,"tutu":1}
```

Maps are notably used by {{< obi obiuniq >}} to aggregate information collected
from the merged sequence records.

```fasta
>my_seq_O1 {"merged_sample":{"sample1":45,"sample_2":33}}
gctagctagctgtgatgtcgtagttgctgatgctagtgctagtcgtaaaaaat
```

Using the {{< obi obiannotate >}} command, it is possible to edit these annotations,
by adding some new ones, deleting some others, renaming keys or changing values. 

> [!CAUTION]
> You are free to add, edit and delete even the {{% obitools4 %}}
> reserved keys to mimic the results of an {{% obitools4 %}} commands. But take
> care of the impact of such manually modified values. It is of better usage, to
> not change reserved annotation keys.

## {{% obitools4 %}} and the taxonomic information

One of the advantages of the {{% obitools %}} is their ability to handle taxonomy annotations.
Each sequence in a sequence file can be individually taxonomically annotated by adding a `taxid` tag to it. Although several annotation tags can be related to taxonomic information, only the `taxid` tag really matters.

The tags associated with taxonomic annotations fall into three categories
- `taxid` The main taxonomic annotation
- Any tag ending with the suffix `_taxid` contains secondary taxid annotations, such as `family_taxid` which contains the taxid at the family level.
- Text tags ending with `_name`, such as `scientific_name` or `family_name`, which contain the textual representation corresponding to the taxids.

The last category is only for user convenience, to make the taxonomic information more humanly understandable. The second category is also to help the user, knowing that any selection based on the taxonomy implemented by {{% obitools4 %}} is based only on the `taxid` tag.

Taxonomic identifiers, *taxid*, are short strings that uniquely identify a taxon within a taxonomy. It is important to rely on *taxid* rather than Latin names to identify taxa, as several taxa share the same Latin name (*e.g.* Vertebrata is also a genus of red algae).

For example, in the (NCBI taxonomy)[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/taxonomy] the species *Homo sapiens* has the taxid *9606* and belongs to the genus *Homo*, which has the taxid *9605*. Although all NCBI taxids are numeric, the {{% obitools4 %}} treats them as strings: `"9606"` and `"9605"`.

The minimal way to specify a taxid to obitools is to provide this short string: `"9606"` or `"9605"`.

If the `--taxonomy` or `-t` option, which takes a filename as parameter, is used when calling a {{% obitools %}} command, the corresponding taxonomy will be loaded and every taxid present in a file (`taxid` and `*_taxid` tags) will be checked against the taxonomy. To download a copy of the (NCBI taxonomy)[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/taxonomy] you can use the {{< obi obitaxonomy >}} command:

```bash
obitaxonomy --download-ncbi --out ncbitaxo.tgz
```

This will create a new file `ncbitaxo.tgz` containing a local copy of the complete taxonomy.

The first consequence of this check is that all taxa are rewritten in their long form. `"9606"` becomes `"taxon:9606 [Homo sapien]@species"`:

- `taxon`: is the taxonomy code (`taxon` is for the (NCBI taxonomy)[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/taxonomy]).
- 9606`: is the taxid
- Homo sapiens`: is the scientific name
- `species`: is the taxonomic rank

So the long form of a taxid can be written as `"TAXOCOD:TAXID [SCIENTIFIC NAME]@RANK"`.

If you look at the following files, you can see that the `taxid` tag is set to `62275` and `9606` for the first and second sequences respectively:

{{< code "two_sequences.fasta" "fasta" true >}}

If you use {{< obi obiconvert >}} without specifying a taxonomy, its only action is to convert the numeric taxids (`62275` and `9606`) to their string equivalents (`"62275"` and `"9606"`).

```bash
obiconvert two_sequences.fasta
```
```fasta
>AB061527 {"count":1,"definition":"Sorex unguiculatus mitochondrial NA, complete genome.","family_name":"Soricidae","family_taxid":"9376","genus_name":"Sorex","genus_taxid":"9379","obicleandb_level":"family","obicleandb_trusted":2.2137847111025621e-13,"species_name":"Sorex unguiculatus","species_taxid":"62275","taxid":"62275"}

ttagccctaaactctagtagttacattaacaaaaccattcgtcagaatactacgagcaac
agcttaaaactcaaaggacctggcagttctttatatccct
```

If the previously downloaded NCBI taxonomy is specified to {{<obi obiconvert >}}, the output of the command will be as follows. You will notice that this time the taxa are given in their long form. The scientific name and taxonomic rank are also given.

```bash
obiconvert -t ncbitaxo.tgz two_sequences.fasta
```
```fasta
>AB061527 {"count":1,"definition":"Sorex unguiculatus mitochondrial NA, complete genome.","family_name":"Soricidae","family_taxid":"taxon:9376 [Soricidae]@family","genus_name":"Sorex","genus_taxid":"taxon:9379 [Sorex]@genus","obicleandb_level":"family","obicleandb_trusted":2.2137847111025621e-13,"species_name":"Sorex unguiculatus","species_taxid":"taxon:62275 [Sorex unguiculatus]@species","taxid":"taxon:62275 [Sorex unguiculatus]@species"}

agcttaaaactcaaaggacctggcagttctttatatccct
```


If the check reveals that taxid is not described in the taxonomy, a warning is emitted by the {{% obitools4 %}}.
As example, the {{< obi obiconvert >}} command applied to the following file:

{{< code "four_sequences.fasta" "fasta" true >}}

provides the following warning:

```bash
obiconvert -t ncbitaxo.tgz four_sequences.fasta
```
```

```

Of the four sequences, only the first sequence has a taxid known from the NCBI taxonomy. The other three sequences have taxids that are not part of the NCBI taxonomy. In fact, the second and third sequences have taxids that were known in the NCBI taxonomy, but are now transferred to other taxids. The fourth sequence has a taxid that is actually unknown in the NCBI taxonomy. 

Since only the first sequence *AY189646* has a known taxid in the output, the taxids are rewritten in long format only for this sequence. For the other three sequences, the taxids are left as they are. Nevertheless, the four sequences are present in the output.

```fasta

```

If the `--update-taxid` option is used, the {{% obitools4 %}} command will update the taxids of the sequences that have been transferred to other taxids. When run on the same sequence file, you can see the same three warnings, but the first two warnings announce the update of the taxids.

```bash
obiconvert -t ncbitaxo.tgz --update-taxid four_sequences.fasta
```
```
WARN[0007] AF023201: Taxid: 67561 is updated to taxon:305503 [Lepidomeda copei]@species

WARN[0007] KC236422: Taxid: 5799994 is unknown from taxonomy (Taxid 5799994 is not part of the taxonomy NCBI Taxonomy) 
```

In the output, the taxids are rewritten in long format for the first sequence as before, but also for the next two sequences, taking into account the update of their taxids.

```fasta

If the `--fail-on-taxonomy` option is used, the {{% obitools4 %}} command will abort if it encounters a taxid that is not in the NCBI taxonomy. If it is run on the same sequence file, you will see the error message that stops the command on the reading of the last sequence annotated with a taxid that is not in the NCBI taxonomy. If the `--update-taxid` option was not used, the command would also have aborted on the sequence AF023201.

```bash
obiconvert -t ncbitaxo.tgz --update-taxid --fail-on-taxonomy four_sequences.fasta
```
```

To remove the invalid taxids from your file, you can use {{< obi obigrep >}} to preserve only sequences with a valid taxid.
This is the role of the `--valid-taxid' option.

```bash
obigrep -t ncbitaxo.tgz \
        --update-taxid \
        --valid-taxid four_sequences.fasta
```
```
WARN[0006] KC236422: Taxid: 5799994 is unknown from taxonomy (Taxid 5799994 is not part of the taxonomy NCBI Taxonomy) 
WARN[0006] AF023201: Taxid: 67561 is updated to taxon:305503 [Lepidomeda copei]@species 
WARN[0006] JN897380: Taxid: 1114968 is updated to taxon:2734678 [Neotrypaea thermophila]@species 
```

If the same three warnings occur, you will notice that only the first three sequences are preserved in the resulting file.

## Manipulating paired sequence files with {{% obitools4 %}}

Sequencing machines, particularly Illumina machines, produce paired-read data sets.
The two paired reads correspond to two sequencings of the same DNA molecule from either end. They are commonly referred to as 'forward reads' and 'reverse reads'.

Today, these paired reads are provided to the biologist in the form of two {{% fastq %}} files.
These files assume that the two reads corresponding to the sequencing of the same DNA molecule are in the same position in the two files. If the data manipulations that delete or insert sequences in these files are not performed symmetrically, it is very likely that they will be out of phase, so that the two sequences will no longer be in the same position.

{{< code "forward.fastq" fastq true >}}
  
{{< code "reverse.fastq" fastq true >}}

In the two files above, the first sequence of the [`forward.fastq`](forward.fastq) file with the ID `M01334:147:000000000-LBRVD:1:1101:14968:1570` is paired with the first sequence of the [`reverse.fastq`](reverse.fastq) file with the same ID `M01334:147:000000000-LBRVD:1:1101:14968:1570`, not because they have the same identifier, but because they are both the first sequence of their respective files.

Some of the {{% obitools4 %}} commands, such as {{< obi obiconvert >}}, {{< obi obigrep >}} or {{< obi obiannotate >}} offer a `--paired-with` option. This option takes a filename as a parameter. It tells the {{% obitools4 %}} command that the file given as an argument is paired with the file being processed. Therefore, the {{% obitools4 %}} commands will process both the forward and reverse files in parallel.

Because the `--paired-with` option makes the {{% obitools4 %}} command process two files, it also produces two result files. Therefore, standard output cannot be used to return the results. Therefore, when using the `--paired-with` option, the `--out` option must be used. The `--out` option takes a filename as a parameter and tells the {{% obitools4 %}} command to write the result to the specified file. As a single filename is given, the {{% obitools4 %}} command modifies this filename by adding a suffix `_R1` and `_R2` to create two filenames.

```bash
obiconvert --paired-with reverse.fastq \
           --out result.fasta \
           --fasta-output \
           forward.fastq 
```

This command processes the [`forward.fastq`](forward.fastq) and the [`reverse.fastq`](reverse.fastq) as two paired files. It then converts them into two fasta files named [`result_R1.fasta`](result_R1.fasta) and [`result_R2.fasta`](result_R2.fasta) for the forward and reverse reads respectively.

```bash
ls -l *.fast?
```
```
-rw-r--r--@ 1 myself  staff  1504  8 mar 15:09 forward.fastq
-rw-r-----@ 1 myself  staff   964  8 mar 17:36 result_R1.fasta
-rw-r-----@ 1 myself  staff   964  8 mar 17:36 result_R2.fasta
-rw-r--r--@ 1 myself  staff  1504  8 mar 15:09 reverse.fastq
```

The `ls` command is used here to see the results of the above {{< obi obiconvert >}} command, with the two resulting files and their names built by adding the suffixes at the end of the filename just before the extension.
