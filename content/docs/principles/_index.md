# General operating principles for {{% obitools %}}

{{% obitools %}} are a set of UNIX commands that are used from a command line interface, also named a terminal, to perform various tasks on DNA sequences files. A UNIX command can be considered as a black box that takes a set of inputs and produces a set of outputs.

Most {{% obitools %}} take a single input file and produce a single output file. Among the inputs, one has a special status, the standard input (*stdin*). Symmetrically, there is the standard output (*stdout*). By default, as any other UNIX command, the {{% obitools %}} read their data from *stdin* and write their results to *stdout*.

If nothing is specified, the UNIX system connects standard input to the terminal keyboard and standard output to the terminal screen. So if you run the `obiconvert' command in your terminal without any arguments, it will appear to stop and do nothing, when in fact it is waiting for you to type something on the keyboard. To stop it, just press *Ctrl+D* to indicate the end of input.

## Specifying the input data

{{% obitools %}} are dedicated to process DNA sequences files. Thus, most of them accept as inputs, DNA sequences files. They can be formatted following on the common sequence file formats, {{% fasta %}}, {{% fastq %}}, {{% embl %}} and {{% genbank %}} flat files. Data can also be provided as CSV files. The {{% obitools %}} usually recognize the file format of the input data, but options are provided to force a specific format (*i.e.* `--fasta`, `--fastq`, `--genbank`, `--embl`).

The most common way to specify the file containing the DNA sequences to be processed is to specify its name as an argument. Here is an example using {{< obi obicount >}} to count the number of DNA sequences in a file named `my_file.fasta`.

```bash
obicount my_file.fasta
```

But it is also possible to pass the data using the Unix redirection mecanism (*i.e.* `>` and `<`, [more details](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redirection_(computing))).

```bash
obicount < my_file.fasta
```

The {{% obitools %}} can also be used to process a set of files. In this case, the {{% obitools %}} will process the files in the order in which they appear on the command line.

```bash
obicount my_file1.fasta my_file2.fasta my_file3.fasta
```

The wildcard character (*i.e.* `*`) can be used to specify a set of files to be processed.

```bash
obicount my_file*.fasta
```

If the files are in a subdirectory, the directory name can be specified, without the need to specify any file name. In that case, the {{% obitools %}} will process all the sequence files present in the subdirectory. The search for the sequence files is done recursively in the specified directory and all its subdirectories.

```bash
obicount my_sub_directory
```

The files considered as DNA sequence files are those with the file extension `.fasta`, `.fastq`, `.genbank` or `.embl`, `.seq` or `.dat`. Files with the second extension `.gz` (*e.g.* `.fasta.gz`) are also considered to be DNA sequence files.

Imagine a folder called `Genbank` which contains a complete copy of the genbank organised into subdirectories, one per division. Each division subdirectory contains a set of {{% fasta %}} compressed (`.gz`) files.

```
. ðŸ“‚ Genbank
â””â”€â”€ ðŸ“‚ bct
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ ðŸ“„ gbbact1.fasta.gz
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ ðŸ“„ gbbact2.fasta.gz
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ ðŸ“„ gbbact3.fasta.gz
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ ðŸ“„ ...
â””â”€â”€ ðŸ“‚ inv
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ ðŸ“„ gbinv1.fasta.gz
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ ðŸ“„ gbinv2.fasta.gz
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ ðŸ“„ gbinv3.fasta.gz
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ ðŸ“„...
â””â”€â”€ ðŸ“‚ mam
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ ðŸ“„ gbmam1.fasta.gz
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ ðŸ“„ gbmam2.fasta.gz
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ ðŸ“„ gbmam3.fasta.gz
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ ðŸ“„...
â””â”€â”€ ðŸ“‚...
â”‚
```

It is possible to count entries in the `gbbact1.fasta.gz` file with the command

```bash
obicount Genbank/bct/gbbact1.fasta.gz
```

to count the entries in the bac (bacterial) division with the command

```bash {linenos=table}
obicount Genbank/bct
```

or to count the entries in the complete Genbank copy with the command

```bash
obicount Genbank
```

## Specifying what to do with the output

By default, {{% obitools %}} write their output to standard output (*stdout*), which means that the results of a command are printed to the terminal screen. 

Most {{% obitools %}} produce sequence files as output. The sequence data is output in {{% fasta %}} or {{% fastq %}} format, depending on whether it contains quality scores ({{% fastq %}}) or not ({{% fasta %}}). The output format for sequence files can be forced using the `--fasta-output` or `--fastq-output` options. If the `--fastq-output` option is used for a data set without quality information, a default quality score of 40 will be used for each base. A third option is the `--json-output` option, which outputs the data in a {{% json %}} format.

Except for {{< obi obisummary >}}, the {{% obitools %}} which produce other types of data output them in CSV format. The {{< obi obisummary >}} command returns its results in JSON or YAML format.
