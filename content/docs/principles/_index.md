# General operating principles for {{% obitools %}}

{{% obitools %}} are a set of UNIX commands that are used from a command line interface, also named a terminal, to perform various tasks on DNA sequences files. A UNIX command can be considered as a black box that takes a set of inputs and produces a set of outputs.

Most {{% obitools %}} take a single input file and produce a single output file. Among the inputs, one has a special status, the standard input (*stdin*). Symmetrically, there is the standard output (*stdout*). By default, as any other UNIX command, the {{% obitools %}} read their data from *stdin* and write their results to *stdout*.

If nothing is specified, the UNIX system connects standard input to the terminal keyboard and standard output to the terminal screen. So if you run the `obiconvert' command in your terminal without any arguments, it will appear to stop and do nothing, when in fact it is waiting for you to type something on the keyboard. To stop it, just press *Ctrl+D* to indicate the end of input.

{{% obitools %}} are dedicated to process DNA sequences files. Thus, most of them accept as inputs, DNA sequences files. They can be formated using on the the common sequence file formats, {{% fasta %}}, {{% fastq %}}, {{% embl %}} and {{% genbank %}} flat files.
