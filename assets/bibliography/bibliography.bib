@article{Pearson:1988aa,
	abstract = {We have developed three computer programs for comparisons of
              protein and DNA sequences. They can be used to search sequence
              data bases, evaluate similarity scores, and identify periodic
              structures based on local sequence similarity. The FASTA program
              is a more sensitive derivative of the FASTP program, which can be
              used to search protein or DNA sequence data bases and can compare
              a protein sequence to a DNA sequence data base by translating the
              DNA data base as it is searched. FASTA includes an additional step
              in the calculation of the initial pairwise similarity score that
              allows multiple regions of similarity to be joined to increase the
              score of related sequences. The RDF2 program can be used to
              evaluate the significance of similarity scores using a shuffling
              method that preserves local sequence composition. The LFASTA
              program can display all the regions of local similarity between
              two sequences with scores greater than a threshold, using the same
              scoring parameters and a similar alignment algorithm; these local
              similarities can be displayed as a ``graphic matrix'' plot or as
              individual alignments. In addition, these programs have been
              generalized to allow comparison of DNA or protein sequences based
              on a variety of alternative scoring matrices.},
