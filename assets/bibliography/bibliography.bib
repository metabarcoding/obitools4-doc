@article{Pearson:1988aa,
	abstract = {We have developed three computer programs for comparisons of
              protein and DNA sequences. They can be used to search sequence
              data bases, evaluate similarity scores, and identify periodic
              structures based on local sequence similarity. The FASTA program
              is a more sensitive derivative of the FASTP program, which can be
              used to search protein or DNA sequence data bases and can compare
              a protein sequence to a DNA sequence data base by translating the
              DNA data base as it is searched. FASTA includes an additional step
              in the calculation of the initial pairwise similarity score that
              allows multiple regions of similarity to be joined to increase the
              score of related sequences. The RDF2 program can be used to
              evaluate the significance of similarity scores using a shuffling
              method that preserves local sequence composition. The LFASTA
              program can display all the regions of local similarity between
              two sequences with scores greater than a threshold, using the same
              scoring parameters and a similar alignment algorithm; these local
              similarities can be displayed as a ``graphic matrix'' plot or as
              individual alignments. In addition, these programs have been
              generalized to allow comparison of DNA or protein sequences based
              on a variety of alternative scoring matrices.},

	abstract = "Metabarcoding of environmental DNA (eDNA) and DNA extracted from
				bulk specimen samples is a powerful tool in studies of
				biodiversity, diet and ecological interactions as its inherent
				labelling of amplicons allows sequencing of taxonomically
				informative genetic markers from many samples in parallel.
				However, the occurrence of so-called 'tag-jumps' can cause
				incorrect assignment of sequences to samples and artificially
				inflate diversity. Two steps during library preparation of pools
				of 5' nucleotide-tagged amplicons have been suggested to cause
				tag-jumps: (a) T4 DNA polymerase blunt-ending in the end-repair
				step and (b) postligation PCR amplification of amplicon libraries.
				The discovery of tag-jumps has led to recommendations to only
				carry out metabarcoding PCR amplifications with primers carrying
				twin-tags to ensure that tag-jumps cannot result in false
				assignments of sequences to samples. As this increases both cost
				and workload, a metabarcoding library preparation protocol which
				circumvents the two steps that causes tag-jumps is needed. Here,
				we demonstrate Tagsteady, a PCR-free metabarcoding Illumina
				library preparation protocol for pools of nucleotide-tagged
				amplicons that enables efficient and cost-effective generation of
				metabarcoding data with virtually no tag-jumps. We use pools of
				twin-tagged amplicons to investigate the effect of T4 DNA
				polymerase blunt-ending and postligation PCR on the occurrence of
				tag-jumps and demonstrate that both blunt-ending and postligation
				PCR, alone or together, can result in detrimental amounts of
				tag-jumps (here, up to ca. 49\% of total sequences), while leaving
				both steps out (the Tagsteady protocol) results in amounts of
				sequences carrying new combinations of used tags (tag-jumps)
				comparable to background contamination.",

  abstract = "Using non-conventional markers, DNA metabarcoding allows
              biodiversity assessment from complex substrates. In this article,
              we present ecoPrimers, a software for identifying new barcode
              markers and their associated PCR primers. ecoPrimers scans whole
              genomes to find such markers without a priori knowledge.
              ecoPrimers optimizes two quality indices measuring taxonomical
              range and discrimination to select the most efficient markers from
              a set of reference sequences, according to specific experimental
              constraints such as marker length or specifically targeted taxa.
              The key step of the algorithm is the identification of conserved
              regions among reference sequences for anchoring primers. We
              propose an efficient algorithm based on data mining, that allows
              the analysis of huge sets of sequences. We evaluate the efficiency
              of ecoPrimers by running it on three different sequence sets:
              mitochondrial, chloroplast and bacterial genomes. Identified
              barcode markers correspond either to barcode regions already in
              use for plants or animals, or to new potential barcodes. Results
              from empirical experiments carried out on a promising new barcode
              for analyzing vertebrate diversity fully agree with expectations
              based on bioinformatics analysis. These tests demonstrate the
              efficiency of ecoPrimers for inferring new barcodes fitting with
              diverse experimental contexts. ecoPrimers is available as an open
              source project at: http://www.grenoble.prabi.fr/trac/ecoPrimers.",

              algorithm's efficiency on many microcomputers, sensitive protein
              database searches may now become a routine procedure for molecular
              biologists. The method efficiently identifies regions of similar
              sequence and then scores the aligned identical and differing
              residues in those regions by means of an amino acid replacability
              matrix. This matrix increases sensitivity by giving high scores to
              those amino acid replacements which occur frequently in evolution.
              The algorithm has been implemented in a computer program designed
              to search protein databases very rapidly. For example, comparison
              of a 200-amino-acid sequence to the 500,000 residues in the
              National Biomedical Research Foundation library would take less
